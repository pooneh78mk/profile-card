What is a README.md in GitHub?

  

GitHub is a popular platform for storing, managing, and sharing source code. A README.md is your GitHub repository’s welcome mat, showing users what your project can do and even serving as a form of documentation. It’s formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to style your writing with special characters that can be interpreted and formatted by browsers.

  

The README.md is usually the first file visitors see when they visit your repository. It should provide an overview of your project, instructions on how to install or use it, and any other essential information. It can also include examples of use cases, highlight specific features, or even provide information on how to contribute to your project if it’s open source.
